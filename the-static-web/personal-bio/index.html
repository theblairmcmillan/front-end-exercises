      <h3>SONGWRITER - <time>2013-2015</time></h3>
      <section>
        <p>As a songwriter, Blair McMillan delivers deeply personal vignettes of the world as he views it. Not one to ramble on, his songs cut to the chase and cut to the very core of the listener. His unique ability to create tiny glimmers of humor in even the darkest of song makes for a deeply personal and vulnerable outpouring of lyrically astute songwriting and very real emotion. It’s two chords and the truth type stuff.<br><br>

        In 2014, Blair won the Nairn Book Festival Songwriting Competition judged by accomplished Scottish songwriters Gillian Frame and Findlay Napier. Since arriving in the United States, Blair has appeared as a solo artist on numerous occasions in New York and Nashville as well as appearing at the 2014 Campfire Festival at Club Passim in Cambridge, MA.<br><br>

        In the summer of 2015, Blair toured the west coast of the United States and Canada with David Moss and Emma Beaton in support of his debut release, Religious Song For Non Believers, a collection of original material which McMillan self-released in June 2015.<br><br>

        Blair released his debut album "Religious Songs For Non Believers" at the end of 2015.</p>
