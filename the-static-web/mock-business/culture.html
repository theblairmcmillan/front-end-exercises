      <h2>COMPANY CULTURE</h2>
      <p class="culture">The phenomenon of swinging, or at least its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the freer attitudes to sexual activity after the sexual revolution of the 1960s, the invention and availability of the contraceptive pill and the emergence of treatments for many of the sexually transmitted diseases that were known at that time.

      The swinger community sometimes refers to itself as "the lifestyle", or as "the alternative lifestyle".[2] The term "wife swapping" or "partner swapping" is criticized for not accurately describing the full range of sexual activities in which both singles or couples may engage,[3] which is not limited to conventional sex with a person other than their regular sex partner. Other terms sometimes encountered are wife sharing, partner sharing, wife trading and wife lending, which describe similar concepts, usually in sociological or anthropological research. As these terms have become dated, with women participating as fully in the decision making process as their male partners, the more gender-neutral term "swinging" has gained popularity.</p>

      <h2>COMPANY EVENTS</h2>
      <p class="culture">Nude recreation refers to recreational activities which some people engage in the nude. Such activities can take place in private spaces, such as in a person's own property or in a naturist context, but also in public areas. Activities in which people engage in the nude include hiking, running (in some contexts this is referred to as streaking), swimming, cycling and yoga. More passive activities include reading, sauna, hot springs, and sunbathing, such as at a nude beach.

      When such activities take place in a public context, they are subject to laws and social attitudes to public nudity. (Exception: In Arkansas, nudism is illegal even while on private property. Furthermore, it is a crime to "promote" or "advocate" nudism.[1]) Most nude recreational activities take place in private places, such as naturist resorts, and when on public lands participants try to be discreet to minimize any potential discomfort it might bring to an accidental passerby. Some public places have been set aside for the use of those who wish to engage in recreational activities in the nude, such as nude beaches.</p>
